# Browser cookie Flask application

This is a very simple Flask application where a user is prompted to insert their username, the username is saved in a database, a session cookie is also issued on the user's browser so that when they come back the program reads the cookie and welcomes back the user. A couple of graphs are also issued on the accesses per user.
