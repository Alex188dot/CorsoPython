1) Preleva, to withdraw money from the account;
2) Versa, to deposit money to the account;
3) Bonifico, to transfer money from the account (fees will be charged);
4) Saldo to look at the total balance;
5) Movimenti, to look at an overview of the transactions (graphs made with Matplotlib)
6) Logout, which will save the progress on a pkl file so next time the balance will be the same, as before quitting the app. 

After inserting the amount and pressing on one of the buttons,   
the user will be given an on screen confirmation and the new total balance will be displayed, example below:

The graphs will be displayed in a new window. The user can save the file from the window directly if they wish to do so.
