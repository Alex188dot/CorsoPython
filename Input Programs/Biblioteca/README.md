# Library Management System

This is a simple Python input program that represents a library management system which allows users to add, reserve, search and return books.   
It uses a list of dictionaries to store the booksâ€™ information, such as title, author, year of publishing and availability.   
The program uses a while loop and a menu to let the user choose an option until they exit the program. The data  
can be saved and stored in a pkl file, that uses the Pickle library.
