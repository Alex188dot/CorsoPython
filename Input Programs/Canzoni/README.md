# Music program
  
This is a simple input Python program that lets the user:   
add new songs, search a song, print all the songs by author on the console and remove a song.

Demo below:

A user can add a song to the collection by inserting the Author, the title and the year it came out. This will create a Song object that will be added to the collection list:
