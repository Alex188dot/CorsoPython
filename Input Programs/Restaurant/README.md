# Restaurant Menu

In this Python input program the user has 3 options to order food: 
1) Fish menu
2) Meat menu
3) Children's menu

The program asks the user which meal they want to order and after asking for the user's email,
it records the meal type, the customer's email and the price of the meal on a table in a dedicated database.
When the program ends (the user presses 0), it prints to the console all the orders on the db,
and the total revenue (sum of the prices on "Customers" table)

Demo below:

A user orders a Fish meal and a Meat meal:

The order is saved on the database:

After logout, the all meals on the "Customers" Table will be printed on the console (in this snippet only the last two), plus the revenue:
