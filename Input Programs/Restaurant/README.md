# Restaurant Menu

In this Python input program the user has 3 options to order food: 
1) Fish menu
2) Meat menu
3) Children's menu

The program asks the user which menu they want to order and after asking for the user's mail
goes to record the type of menu, the customer's email and the price of the menu on a "Customers" table in a dedicated database.
When the program ends (the user presses 0) the program prints all the orders on the db,
and the total revenue (sum of the prices on the "Customers" table)
